# google_calendar_sync

In the past few weeks I've been struggling to manage my personal calendar events, volunteer work meetings, university classes and work agenda. Although I can share my account events between my accounts and access all of them from one account or another, the other calendar aren't visible for my work peers or university coleagues.

In order to solve this problem I wrote a script in Google Apps Script and used some interesting features such as native G suite objects and scheduler in order to automatically sync all my calendars into my companie's calendar.  

I've got a great deal of inspiration from these two articles I've found that tryied to solve the problem:
